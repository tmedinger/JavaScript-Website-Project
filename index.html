                <p>Yeah, I want a date with Bo Derek. We all want things. You shouldn't like things because people tell you you're supposed to.  You shouldn't like things because people tell you you're supposed to. Nancy, seriously, you're gonna be so cool now, it's ridiculous.  It’s about the shadow monster, isn’t it? Bitchin' She shut one door! With her mind! <iframe width="280" height="157.5" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FV88Cl_ErtU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen align= "right"></iframe>
                Nobody normal ever accomplished anything meaningful in this world. Oh... candy, leftovers, Eggo's... she really likes Eggo's.  Um, I'm happy you're home. Nobody normal ever accomplished anything meaningful in this world. Who would you rather be friends with: Bowie or Kenny Rogers?  So, Jonathan, how was the pull-out? Why do we even need weapons anyway?  We have her. You're an idiot, Steve Harrington. You're beautiful, Nancy Wheeler.

                You’re right. You are a freak…. Who would you rather be friends with: Bowie or Kenny Rogers? Why do we even need weapons anyway? We have her.  We never would've upset you if we knew you had superpowers.  Mistakes have been made. You're an idiot, Steve Harrington. You're beautiful, Nancy Wheeler.
                <br>        
                This is not yours to fix alone. You act like you’re all alone out there in the world, but you’re not. You’re not alone.  He’s a sensitive kid. Lonnie used to say he was queer. Called him a fag. Is he? He’s missing, is what he is! Why do we even need weapons anyway? We have her.
                <br>        
                You’re pretty cute, you know that? Why’s he gotta kick the door? Why’s he gotta kick the door? Don’t take it so personally, okay?  I don’t like most people. He’s in the vast majority. 
                It’s finger-lickin’ good. You're an idiot, Steve Harrington. You're beautiful, Nancy Wheeler.
