                <p>Yeah, I want a date with Bo Derek. We all want things. You shouldn't like things because people tell you you're supposed to.  You shouldn't like things because people tell you you're supposed to. Nancy, seriously, you're gonna be so cool now, it's ridiculous.  It’s about the shadow monster, isn’t it? Bitchin' She shut one door! With her mind! <iframe width="280" height="157.5" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FV88Cl_ErtU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen align= "middle"></iframe>
                Nobody normal ever accomplished anything meaningful in this world. Oh... candy, leftovers, Eggo's... she really likes Eggo's.  Um, I'm happy you're home. Nobody normal ever accomplished anything meaningful in this world.  If we’re both going crazy, then we’ll go crazy together, right? You’re right. You are a freak…. Who would you rather be friends with: Bowie or Kenny Rogers?  So, Jonathan, how was the pull-out? Why do we even need weapons anyway?  We have her. You're an idiot, Steve Harrington. You're beautiful, Nancy Wheeler.

                You’re right. You are a freak…. Who would you rather be friends with: Bowie or Kenny Rogers? Why do we even need weapons anyway? We have her.  We never would've upset you if we knew you had superpowers.  Mistakes have been made. You're an idiot, Steve Harrington. You're beautiful, Nancy Wheeler.
                <br>        
                This is not yours to fix alone. You act like you’re all alone out there in the world, but you’re not. You’re not alone.  He’s a sensitive kid. Lonnie used to say he was queer. Called him a fag. Is he? He’s missing, is what he is! Why do we even need weapons anyway? We have her.
                <br>        
                You’re pretty cute, you know that? Why’s he gotta kick the door? Why’s he gotta kick the door? Don’t take it so personally, okay?  I don’t like most people. He’s in the vast majority. 
                It’s finger-lickin’ good. You're an idiot, Steve Harrington. You're beautiful, Nancy Wheeler.

                You’re pretty cute, you know that? Why do we even need weapons anyway? We have her.  Do you know anything about sensory deprivation tanks? Specifically how to build one?  You shouldn't like things because people tell you you're supposed to. Mistakes have been made.
                <br>        
                You act like you want me to be your friend and then you treat me like garbage. Mouth-breather.  You're an idiot, Steve Harrington. You're beautiful, Nancy Wheeler. Mornings are for coffee and contemplation.  You act like you want me to be your friend and then you treat me like garbage.
                <br>        
                I need my paddles! You’re pretty cute, you know that? Oh... candy, leftovers, Eggo's... she really likes Eggo's.  It's just, sometimes... people don't really say what they're really thinking. But when you capture the right moment, it says more.  He’s a sensitive kid. Lonnie used to say he was queer. Called him a fag. Is he? He’s missing, is what he is!
